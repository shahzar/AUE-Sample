### Features 
#### - Fetching data via REST API 
- Consuming REST API provided by Openweathermap & displaying the fetched data.

#### - Push Notification using GCM
- Chat application using Google Cloud Messaging, including Push Notifications.
- Install provided APK into multiple devices to test this out.



## Compilation
The Visual Studio Solution contains two projects, `AUELibrary` & `AUE Sample`.

`AUELibrary` is a PCL (Portable Class Library) project, containing the data-models & the code for fetching & consuming of REST Api. 

This exists as a seperate project so as to conform to the MVVM Architecture recommended by Xamarin, to seperate the domain layer into a PCL, so the same code can be reused when building for other platforms.

`AUE Sample` contains the main code for Android Platform, including all the Activities, and code related by it.

### NuGet Package Dependencies
#### AUELibrary
- Microsoft.Net.Http
- Newtonsoft.Json
#### AUE Sample
- Xamarin.Firebase.Common
- Xamarin.GooglePlayServices.Basement
